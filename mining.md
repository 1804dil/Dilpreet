# Data Mining 

Data mining is most commonly defined as the process of using computers and automation to search large sets of data for patterns and trends, turning those findings into business insights and predictions. Data mining goes beyond the search process, as it uses data to evaluate future probabilities and develop actionable analyses.

# History of Data Mining

The statistical beginnings of data mining were set into motion by Bayes’ Theorem in 1763 and discovery of regression analysis in 1805. Through the Turing Universal Machine (1936), the discovery of Neural Networks (1943), the development of databases (1970s) and genetic algorithms (1975), and Knowledge Discovery in Databases (1989), the stage was set for our modern understanding of what data mining is today. And, as the growth of computer processors, data storage, and technology exploded during the 1990s and 2000s, data mining became not only more powerful, but also more prolific in all kinds of situations.

In 2003, the book Moneyball introduced data mining to a much broader audience through the story of a professional baseball team’s analytics-driven approach to roster building. Now, with companies employing big data solutions in a growing variety of situations, data mining plays a critical role in countless industries.

# Phases of Data Mining

- Business Understanding
To get started, first ask these questions: What is our objective? What problem are we trying to solve? What data do we need to solve it?
Without a clear understanding of the proper data to mine, the project can produce errors, inaccurate results, or results that don’t answer the correct questions.

- Data Understanding
Once the overall objective is determined, proper data needs to be collected. The data must be relevant to subject matter and usually comes from a variety of sources such as sales records, customer surveys, and geolocation data. This phase’s goal is to ensure the data correctly encompasses all necessary data sets to address the objective.

- Data Preparation
The most time-consuming phase, the preparation phase, consists of three steps: extraction, transformation, and loading — also referred to as ETL. First, data is extracted from various sources and deposited into a staging area. Next, during the transformation step: the data is cleaned, null sets are populated, duplicative data is removed, errors are resolved, and all data is allocated into tables. In the final step, loading, the formated data is loaded into the database for use.

- Modeling
Data modeling addresses the relevant data set and considers the best statistical and mathematical approach to answering the objective question(s). There are a variety of modeling techniques available, such as classification, clustering, and regression analysis (more on them later). It’s also not uncommon to use different models on the same data to address specific objectives.

- Evaluation
After the models are built and tested, it’s time to evaluate their efficiency in answering the question identified during the business understanding phase. This is a human-driven phase, as the individual running the project must determine whether the model output sufficiently meets their objectives. If not, a different model can be created, or different data can be prepared.

- Deployment
Once the data mining model is deemed accurate and successful in answering the objective question, it’s time to put it to use. Deployment can occur in the form of a visual presentation or a report sharing insights. It also can lead to action such as generating a new sales strategy or implementing risk-reduction measures.

# Examples of Data Mining

The following are a few real-world examples of data:

- Shopping Market Analysis
In the shopping market, there is a big quantity of data, and the user must manage enormous amounts of data using various patterns. To do the study, market basket analysis is a modeling approach. 

Market basket analysis is basically a modeling approach that is based on the notion that if you purchase one set of products, you're more likely to purchase another set of items. This strategy may help a retailer understand a buyer's purchasing habits. Using differential analysis, data from different businesses and consumers from different demographic groups may be compared.

- Weather Forecasting Analysis
For prediction, weather forecasting systems rely on massive amounts of historical data. Because massive amounts of data are being processed, the appropriate data mining approach must be used.

- Stock Market Analysis
In the stock market, there is a massive amount of data to be analyzed. As a result, data mining techniques are utilized to model such data in order to do the analysis.

- Intrusion Detection
Well, data mining can assist to enhance intrusion detection by focusing on anomaly detection. It assists an analyst in distinguishing between unusual network activity and normal network activity.

- Fraud Detection
Traditional techniques of fraud detection are time-consuming and difficult due to the amount of data. Data mining aids in the discovery of relevant patterns and the transformation of data into information.

- Surveillance
Well, video surveillance is utilized practically everywhere in everyday life for security perception. Because we must deal with a huge volume of acquired data, data mining is employed in video surveillance.

- Financial Banking
With each new transaction in computerized banking, a massive amount of data is expected to be created. By identifying patterns, causalities, and correlations in corporate data, data mining may help solve business challenges in banking and finance.

# Challenges of Implementation in Data Mining

Because data handling technology is always improving, leaders confront additional obstacles in addition to scalability and automation, as mentioned below:

- Distributed Data
Real-world data saved on several platforms, such as databases, individual systems, or the Internet, cannot be transferred to a centralized repository. Regional offices may have their own servers to store data, but storing data from all offices centrally will be impossible. As a result, tools and algorithms for mining dispersed data must be created for data mining.

- Complex Data
It takes a long time and money to process big amounts of complicated data. Data in the real world is structured, unstructured,semi-structured, and heterogeneous forms, including multimedia such as photos, music, video, natural language text, time series, natural, and so on, making it challenging to extract essential information from many sources in LAN and WAN.

- Domain Knowledge
It is simpler to dig some information with domain expertise, without which collecting useful information from data might be tough.

- Data Visualization
The first interaction that presents the result correctly to the client is data visualization. The information is conveyed with unique relevance based on its intended use. However, it is difficult to accurately address the information to the end-user. To make the information relevant, effective output information, input data, and complicated data perception methods must be used.

- Incomplete Data
Large data amounts might be imprecise or unreliable owing to measurement equipment problems. Customers that refuse to disclose their personal information may result in incomplete data, which may be updated owing to system failures, resulting in noisy data, making the data mining procedure difficult.

- Security and Privacy
Decision-making techniques necessitate security through data exchange for people, organizations, and the government. Private and sensitive information about individuals is gathered for customer profiles in order to better understand user activity trends. Illegal access and the confidentiality of the information are significant issues here.

# The Future of Data Mining

The future of data mining is bright, as data volumes continue to grow. Mining techniques have changed as a result of technological advancements, as have systems that extract useful information from data. Previously, only companies such as NASA could utilize their supercomputers to examine data since the expense of storing and calculating data was prohibitively expensive.

Companies are now experimenting with machine learning, artificial intelligence, and deep learning on cloud-based data lakes.

The Internet of Things and wearable technologies have transformed people and gadgets into data-generating machines capable of producing infinite knowledge about individuals and organizations. This is how businesses can gather, store, and analyze massive amounts of data.

Cloud-based analytics solutions will make it easier and more cost-effective for businesses to access huge amounts of data and processing power. Cloud computing enables businesses to swiftly receive and act on data from sales, marketing, Internet, manufacturing, and inventory systems, among other sources, in order to enhance their bottom line.
